<h1>Vite Project - Test Flow Manager</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project is a web application built using Vite, React Flow, and Javascript It allows you to visualize and manage test scenarios and test cases using nodes and edges. The application is designed to help with the organization and documentation of test scenarios in a clear, visual format. This test flow focuses on the user's journey in navigating through the features and pages of a project</p>

<i>Note: This website still being developed and there's still a lot of issues with the project and functions. Feel free to message me If you have suggestions or comments! redenlongcop5@gmail.com</i>

<h2>New Update/s:</h2>
<span>
    <h3>• Test Automation:</h3> Added a new feature where you can integrate your robotframework automation script on each test cases.<br><br>
    This works by using the unique ID of the testcase as a <i>tag</i> to run your robotframework automation. You can clone this sample test script: <a href='https://github.com/Code-Me-N0t/Test-Login'>Sample Robotframework Test</a> or you can create a seperate project on your local computer.
    <br><br>
    <p><i>Note: Make sure that you modify the <em>run_automation.py</em> with your robot's project name along with its directory.</i></p>
